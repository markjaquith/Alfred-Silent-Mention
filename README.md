# Alfred Silent Mention
[Alfred 4][alfred] workflow to silently type `@usernames`, `domains.com`, or `#hashtags` without them being linked or parsed by Twitter, Slack, iMessage, and more.

For example, you can type `@stop` on Twitter without poor [Doug Bowman][stop] getting a notification.
Or you could type `WordPress.com` or `Amazon.com` in Slack without a big annoying preview loading in.

## Installation
1. Have [Alfred][alfred] installed.
2. Have the [Alfred Powerpack][powerpack] installed.
3. [Download the Silent Mention workflow file][download], and doubleclick it to add it to Alfred.
4. Customize the keyword if you want (default is `silent`).

## Usage
Invoke Alfred, then type `silent @username` or `silent amazon.com` or `silent #hashtag` and hit return. The thing you typed will be pasted into the frontmost app, but will **not** be seen as a username mention, a domain link, or a valid hashtag.

## How It Works
It works by inserting a "zero-width space" character (which is like a space, but without any width, so it's invisible) in a location that breaks the parsing. So, to Twitter, it looks like `WordPress .com` (with a space), but to a human's eyes, it is just `WordPressâ€‹.com` (that one has a zero-width space in it).

## Works On
* Twitter
* Slack
* iMessage
* GitHub
* And more
